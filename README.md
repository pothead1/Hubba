## 🧬 Manifesto: Why GanjaGuru Exists

**GanjaGuru** was born from a spark—a realization that the cannabis community deserves more than stale online stores and cookie-cutter menus.

We built a **portal**, not a website.  
A **culture engine**, not a cart.  
A **fully automated eco-system**, not a side hustle.

This is for:
- 🌱 The growers
- 🔮 The dreamers
- 💻 The technomancers
- 💨 The stoners with vision

**Welcome home.**

> Immersive. Monetized. Sustainable. Interactive. Animated. AI-Powered.
